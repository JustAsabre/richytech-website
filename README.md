   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following:
     ```
     MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/richytech
     JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
     NODE_ENV=development

How to Deploy Online

 Prerequisites
1. A hosting platform for the frontend (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
2. A hosting platform for the backend (e.g., Render, Heroku).
3. A cloud database for MongoDB (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).

 Steps
1. Frontend Deployment:
   - Upload the frontend files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, etc.) to your hosting platform.
   - Update API URLs in JavaScript files to point to the backend's deployed URL.

2. Backend Deployment:
   - Push the `backend` folder to your hosting platform.
   - Set environment variables (`MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, etc.) in the hosting platform's settings.

3. Connect Frontend and Backend:
   - Ensure the frontend uses the correct API URLs for the backend.

4. Access the Website:
   - Use the frontend's deployed URL to access the website.

---

Testing
- API Testing: Use `backend/test.js` or `backend/test.html` to test API endpoints.
- Frontend Testing: Open the website in a browser and interact with its features.

---

Notes
- Ensure MongoDB is running locally or use a cloud database.
- Update CORS settings in `backend/server.js` for production.
